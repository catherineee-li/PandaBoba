# PandaBoba
A site where you learn about boba and pandas.
Boba is the greatest thing ever invented 
And pandas are the kings of the world and should be kept in every household
My favorite boba place is cha 4 tea in long beach and irvine because they have honey green milk tea and their popcorn chicken is super delcious. 
Next would be class 302 cause quantity is over quality, but if you go go to the one in downey cause you can put as much boba as you want (after covid).
Also random comment, but doesn't boba look just like pandas and aren't pandas just the cutest creatures ever. 
If you really want high quality boba go to Taiwan cause thats were the good boba really is trust me :) 
Share tea is pretty good in Cerritos and Meet fresh, but their shaved ice is honestly better than their boba. 
Also if you like pandas you should go get a panda squishmellow from amazon. You should also invest in the pandas the sell at daiso and go to the zoo alot. 
Also but some bamboo in your room like me so that your panda stays with you at all times (I'm serious about this I actually have bamboo in my room :)
